This script is designed to help users manage and store contact information. It allows you to add, search, modify, and view details about individuals. You can register a person's name and associated details (such as phone number, address, email, etc.), store them in a file, and later search or update the information. It's an easy-to-use tool for keeping track of personal contacts with added customization options for categories and additional details.

### Option 1: Register a New Contact 📖
This option allows the user to add a new contact to the directory. The user can input a name and a phone number, and then add additional details (e.g., address, email, profession) by specifying categories. The contact’s information is saved in a central file and also in a separate file for the individual contact.

### Option 2: View Contact Information 🪪
This option lets the user search for and view contact information. You can search for a contact either by their name or by their phone number. If a match is found, the full details of the contact will be displayed. If no contact is found, an appropriate message will be shown.

### Option 3: Modify Contact Information ✏️
With this option, the user can update the details of an existing contact. You can change the contact’s name, phone number, or modify the categories (e.g., address, email). If a category already exists, it can be updated, or new categories can be added. The updated information is then saved in both the central directory file and the individual contact’s file.

### Option 0: Exit 🚪
This option allows the user to exit the program with a friendly exit message. The program will stop running when this option is selected.
